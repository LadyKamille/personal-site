## Firejolt Caf√© Magazine Stand

My first DM attempt was to run Strixhaven online for some friends, it didn't last but it did birth these magical magazine ideas.

My husband plays in both my in-person and online game. For Strixhaven, he was basically playing an Owlin Pierce Hawthorne. I don't remember the exact context but in his attempts to sound cool, he made up some magazine name he enjoyed reading. That magazine was "Dungeon Delversmopolitan."

So I get to work not actually prepping the next session but doing bad photoshop and writing ridiculous articles to fill up my fake magazine stand. I was laughing at myself the entire time and couldn't wait until our next session. It was painfully hard not telling my husband what I had made.

After waiting my two weeks, it was finally time. I could not emphasize the magazines enough and just waited until they saw the journal icon on the foundry map. Not for the first, or last time, I deeply wished we were playing in person so that I didn't just watch everyone laughing on mute, but it was still a good time. I think the most ridiculous moments are what we remember most when a campaign is over.
