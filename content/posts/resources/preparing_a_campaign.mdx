Preparing for a campaign can be really intimidating, reading an entire sourcebook is no small feat. If you are a brand new DM, having to learn all of the rules on top of that can feel overwhelming.

I've only been DMing for a little over a year and it gets easier every time (even if that quesy feeling before every session doesn't). I've learned a couple of things that make it easier for me that hopefully can help you prep your next campaign or session.

## Player Surveys

The first campaign I started running was actually Strixhaven and I was running it online for a group of 5. Four of the players are people I've played with for years (one being our forever DM) and the other was my cousin who was playing D&D for the first time. Since this is an RP heavy campaign, I wanted to make sure everyone built a well rounded character, so I made a "Player Question" survey on google forms. I stole most of these questions from other blogs and reddit, so I cannot take full credit but it was extremely helpful for me and my players.

I will share some of the questions here, but I will also share the full form:

The questions are a mix of information about the character and also what the player likes to see in a campaign they are playing in.

Some examples of character questions:

1. What does your character hate/fear/love?
2. Name something your character would kill to learn.
3. Name a habit for your character.

Examples of player questions, these are presented as a scale from 1-5.

What type of game do you want to play?

1. Dungeon Delving With Traps and Monsters
2. Exploration
3. Political Intrigue and Social Subterfuge
4. Wacky Zany Adventures or Dark and Serious
5. What level of role play are you into?
6. What level of danger are you looking for?
7. How important is the accumulation of wealth?
8. How important are rules to you?

## Retrospectives

I am a software engineer by trade which I think shows in how I prep for D&D. After every session, I send out another google form that is a "Retrospective." I found that players are usually hesitant to give constructive feedback after sessions. I thought maybe if it is anonymous and more structured, it will help me get a feel for how much people are enjoying the game.

1. How would you rate the session? (1-5)
2. Is there anything I can do to make it more enjoyable?
3. What was your favorite moment?
4. What are your goals for next week?
5. Any other comments?
