PLAYERS BEWARE. This blog post contains spoilers for Curse of Strahd.

I've decided to blog our CoS sessions for two reasons.

1. Maybe I'll finally take notes
2. Maybe my ideas are actually pretty decent and people will find it helpful.

## The Doomed Souls

1. Atronus Irongazer - Dwarf - Fighter - Battle Master
2. Bartholomew "Arty" Beram - Satyr - Sorcerer - Divine Soul
3. Ember Hyland - Fire Genasi - Druid - Circle of Spores
4. Varan Erenaeth - Elf - Monk - Way of the Ascendent Dragon
