PLAYERS BEWARE. This blog post contains spoilers for Curse of Strahd.

I've decided to blog our CoS sessions for two reasons.

1. Maybe I'll finally take notes
2. Maybe my ideas are actually pretty decent and people will find it helpful.

## The Doomed Souls

1. Atronus Irongazer - Dwarf - Fighter - Battle Master
2. Bartholomew "Arty" Beram - Satyr - Sorcerer - Divine Soul
3. Ember Hyland - Fire Genasi - Druid - Circle of Spores
4. Varan Erenaeth - Elf - Monk - Way of the Ascendent Dragon

## Welcome to Barovia

This is actually my second attempt at running Curse of Strahd. My original party fell apart because of very bad players (think seducing sobbing Mad Mary). The first run made it to the burgomaster's mansion in Vallaki. They decided to pick a fight with the burgomaster and the session ended on an unavoidable TPK, so I guess timing worked out pretty well.

I found there were many places to improve from the first game, and turned to reddit and youtube for more ideas. [r/CurseofStrahd](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/) is full of insanely talented people that really bring Barovia to life and help you build a compelling villain.

I took many notes from [DragnaCarta](https://www.reddit.com/user/DragnaCarta/) with his [Curse of Strahd: Reloaded](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/9bpzbh/curse_of_strahd_reloaded_compilation_thread/) supplement. I loved the revamp of the adventure hooks to really weave each character's backstory into the campaign.

I had purchased the [Curse of Strahd box set](https://smile.amazon.com/Curse-Strahd-Revamped-Premium-Dungeons/dp/0786967153/) that came with postcards and I used those to write all of the characters individual fortunes on. When we sat down for the first session, I introduced them to the setting with the dialog provided in the adventure hook guide. After I read that, I went around and handed them all their personal fortunes, that was a huge hit. None of the characters knew each other going in, so I wanted to give the players the power to share (or not share) that information.

### Tarokka Readings

#### Atronus

Legends tell of a powerful, yet lost magical relic. That relic lies forgotten in the vast treasury of the Amber Temple.

> What you seek lies in a pile of treasure, beyond a set of amber doors.

#### Arty

You are an orphan or adopted by your parents. You crave knowledge of your family and the comfort of a household. Izek is your brother, and his twisted form matches your own appearance or demonic spirit.

> A beast has marked your soul, and its twin lurks in the heart of a man shrouded in flame. Marked as a devil, this twisted creature can show you the way to your spirit's cleansing. But, beware! He is no hero

#### Ember

A demon lurks inside you - a shard of one of a dark vestige. You must journey to Yester Hill and confront its source to rid yourself of its influence forevermore.

> The darkness within you is strong, but all is not lost. Its source awaits your coming, atop the hill of the druids. Beware the choice! Beware refusing it!

#### Varan

A close friend or relative of yours vanished into a dark mist, and was turned by Strahd into vampire spawn. Find where Strahd keeps them locked in Castle Ravenloft, and free them from their life of undeath with the gift of a true, good death.

> The blood of your blood has gone cold, and only mist yet remains. Find them in the highest peak, and free them of their unholy torment.

#### Party

This is where I should have done more prep beforehand. Many DMs recommend pre-selecting the cards for the Tarokka reading so that you have more control of the story... I did not do that and it is one of the only two regrets I have running this campaign so far (I'll get to the other later).

- The Tome of Strahd: Torturer - There is a town where all is not well. There you will find a house of corruption, and within, a dark room full of still ghosts.
  - Burgomaster’s mansion in Vallaki
- The Holy Symbol of Ravenkind: Necromancer - A woman hangs above a roaring fire. Find her, and you will find the treasure.
  - Castle Ravenloft’s study
- The Sunsword: Mercenary - The thing you seek lies with the dead, under mountains of gold coins.
  - Amber Temple
- Strahd's Location: Broken One - He haunts the tomb of the man he envied above all.
  - Sergei's tomb
- Executioner - Seek out the brother of the devil's bride. They call him “the lesser,” but he has a powerful soul.
  - Ismark Kolyanovich
